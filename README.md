# üçï Pizza Sales Dashboard


## üìç Pizza Sales Dashboard

This dashboard gives a simple and visual overview of how a fictional pizza company is doing in terms of sales.

It was built using **SQL** (to get the data ready) and **Power BI** (to create the charts and visuals).

The goal? To help anyone ‚Äî whether you're a **business owner**, **data analyst**, or just curious ‚Äî quickly find answers like:

- üçï **Which pizzas sell the most?**
- üìè **Which pizza size makes the most money?**
- üìà **How do sales change over time or across different pizza categories?**

This dashboard turns numbers into insights, helping you make smarter decisions at a glance.



## üåü Key Features

- üßæ **KPI Cards**  
  Instantly see total revenue, total orders, total pizzas sold, and average pizzas per order.

- üéõÔ∏è **Interactive Slicers**  
  Easily filter the dashboard by date, pizza size, or category.

- üìä **Visual Variety**  
  Pie charts, bar graphs, and clustered column charts make it easy to view data across different sales metrics and categories.

- üîç **Drillable Charts**  
  Explore the best and worst sellers dynamically, whether you're looking at revenue, quantity sold, or number of orders.



## üß∞ Tools

Tools Used:

SQL ‚Äì Used for querying and transforming the raw sales data

Power BI ‚Äì Used for data modeling, DAX measures, and dashboard creation



## üßÆ SQL Data Preparation & Metric Calculation


Before building the visual dashboard in Power BI, we used SQL to perform data aggregation and business metric derivation from the raw transactional data. This script was responsible for generating key insights and summarized KPIs that were later visualized in the dashboard.

## Monthly Trends

### Total Orders by Month
Looking at the number of orders throughout the year, we see that **January** and **October** have the most orders. The number of orders tends to go down toward the end of the year, which might be because of less demand after the busy summer months.

This information helps us figure out when we have the most customers and when we might need to do promotions or offer discounts to boost sales.

## Sales Breakdown

### Which Pizza Types Sell the Most?
- **Classic Pizzas**: 23.68% of total sales
- **Supreme Pizzas**: 26.91% of total sales
- **Chicken Pizzas**: 23.56% of total sales
- **Veggie Pizzas**: 23.96% of total sales

Classic and Supreme pizzas make up the biggest chunk of sales. This means we could focus more on promoting these types since people seem to prefer them.

### Which Pizza Sizes are the Most Popular?
- **Large**: 45.89% of sales
- **Medium**: 21.77% of sales
- **Regular**: 30.49% of sales
